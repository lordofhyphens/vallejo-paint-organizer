Paint Bottle Organizer
---------

Simple holder for common 17ml bottles used by Vallejo, Army Painter, etc, for easy storage inside a common plastic drawer organizer.

1x8 (or any combination of smaller versions) fits common plastic pull-out drawers. You can get up to 3 rows and be able to comfortably reach all of the bottles.

I designed this to fit in these drawers:
